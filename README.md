# Joystick test dongle for Amiga Test Kit (Systest)

Test dongle for [Systest ( amiga ) from Keir Fraser](https://github.com/keirf/Amiga-Stuff) ( [download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6F45EdkSMp1ZGhXMWRvOXVDd3M/view) ).

### Why ?

I’m repairing lots of Amiga machines, and my (original) joystick connectors where failing after they have been swapped between all those machines. So that’s why I designed this dongle ( and ofcourse i’m a bit lazy to handle the joystick each time!)

### How does it works

This dongle simulates Up, Right, Down, Left, Button1, Button2, Button3.
There is an interval of approx. 1 second between the simulated actions of the “joystick”.
